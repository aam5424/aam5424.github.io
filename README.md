What features did you implement?
The features I implemented in the site are adding links to my social media, and I have also added a link where, when you click the navigation button, it will take you directly to the home page, contact page, and product page. You can also type on the contact page and leave a message for the owner.

Any additional design choices or deviations from the wireframe (with justification).
I have not added any additional design choices.
